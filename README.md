# sql-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with postgresSQL , including ETL processes , data modeling  and analytics.

#A complete project demonstrating how to design, build, and analyze a modern data warehouse using PostgreSQL, including:#

‚úÖ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes

‚úÖ Data modeling (staging, star schema, fact & dimension tables)

‚úÖ Analytics & reporting

 Project Overview:
--This project aims to provide a hands-on implementation of a data warehouse architecture using PostgreSQL. It covers the full data pipeline lifecycle:
--Data Ingestion (ETL): Extract raw data, clean it, and load it into staging tables.
--Data Modeling: Apply best practices in dimensional modeling to structure data into facts and dimensions.
--Analytics: Run queries and build dashboards to derive insights.

üéØ Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to design and implement a modern data warehouse on PostgreSQL that supports efficient data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis. By the end of this project, the data warehouse will:

Provide a centralized repository for structured and semi-structured data.

Support a reliable ETL pipeline for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading.

Implement data modeling best practices (star schema, fact & dimension tables).

Enable analytical queries and business insights such as revenue trends, customer behavior, and operational KPIs.

Be scalable and extendable for integration with modern BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Metabase).

üìê Project Specifications :: 

Database: PostgreSQL 14+

Architecture:

Raw data ingested into staging tables

Transformed data stored in fact & dimension tables (star schema)

Analytical queries run on the warehouse layer

Data Modeling:

Fact Tables: Sales, Transactions, Events

Dimension Tables: Customers, Products, Dates, Locations

Deployment: Docker Compose (optional) for containerized PostgreSQL instance

Analytics: Example queries included for sales performance, retention, and revenue trends

Scalability: Future support for orchestration tools like Airflow and transformation frameworks like dbt
